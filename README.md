# 🦊 Roqaa - Eye Training Game for Children with Amblyopia (كسل العين)

**Roqaa** is a simple, child-friendly Arabic game designed to support children with amblyopia (lazy eye) by strengthening their weaker eye through daily vision exercises. The game encourages focus and eye movement using fun interactions and auditory feedback from a friendly fox character 🦊.

## 🎮 Game Idea

Children are asked to wear an eye patch over their healthy eye and use their weaker eye to follow a moving star on the screen. After the star stops, they must guess and tap where it landed. This daily exercise helps enhance focus and eye control in a playful, stress-free environment.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- 🟠 **Level 1**: A large star moves slowly in a horizontal line.  
- 🟡 **Level 2**: A smaller star moves vertically and a bit faster.  
- 🔴 **Level 3**: A tiny star moves in both directions with faster speed.  

Kids are encouraged to complete all three levels **daily** as part of their therapy routine.
